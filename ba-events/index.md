## Guests

You can request to bring one guest. Therefore, in the sign-ups, you will have three options: First, if you prefer to come alone. Second, if you prefer to come and bring a guest, but be willing to join alone if your guest does not get a place. Third, if you prefer to come and bring a guest, but not be willing to join alone if your guest does not get a place.

## Ballot

If we have more sign-ups than places, we will do a ballot, in which we prioritise BAs. In detail, the ballot will work as follows. If more BAs sign up than places, we will do the ballot among all BAs that like to come alone and those that like to bring a guest but are also willing to come alone. If less BAs sign up than places, we will first allocate a place to all BAs that like to come alone and those that like to bring a guest but are also willing to come alone. In a second step, we will ballot the guest tickets, including also the BAs that only like to come with a guest. All BAs or guests that do not get a place in the ballot are added to a waiting list.

## Cancellation

After the sign-up has closed, we will notify you as soon as possible if you got a place. Then, you will have one full day (24h) time to decide if you (and your guest) want to accept the place or if you want to drop out free of charge. If you (or your guest) drop-out later and there is no one on the waiting list, you will still get charged the subsidised price. If you (or your guest) do not show up to the event without giving any notice, you will be charged the full (not subsidised) price.

## List of participants

In order to find out who else is joining an event, we will send out a list of participants together with the confirmation email. Therefore, in the sign-up forms, you will be asked if you are happy that your name and email is shared with the other participants if you get a ticket.
